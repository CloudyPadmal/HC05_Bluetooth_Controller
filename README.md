HC05 BluetoothController

Android interface to control the HC-05 bluetooth module to create remote controlled robot. 

It's pretty cool to me driving a robot here and there with this tiny app. 

With this app, you can configure commands as you like. I couldn't find that feature in many available applications in Google Playstore. But I wanted a custom app that uses arrows instead of typing letters. So I made this app after going through many reasearch and self study. I've enabled any user to change the transmitting characters to another character or some robots get strings. So that way, we can control another robot as well not just mine.
